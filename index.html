        <p>Visual studio is a good developed stage when little coders have to handwrite the code. It is also easy to set up the page</p>  
        <p>Console screen is used to show some extra information about the tags we code. Like if we code 1,2,3,4 then if we console it, it will show the value and lenght.</p>
